# -Support-Vector-Machine-
The classification of handwritten digits using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset used for this project is the widely-known online digits dataset. The primary objective is to accurately classify digits (0-9) based on their pixel values, leveraging SVM for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and versatility in classification tasks.
